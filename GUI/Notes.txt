6/10/2016 - HexView section of MemoryViewerWindow.ui: Changed listWidget_HexView_Address to tableWidget_HexView_Address in order to prevent possible future visual bugs. Logically, it should stay as a listwidget considering it's functionality. But it doesn't play nice with the other neighboring tablewidgets in different pyqt versions, forcing me to use magic numbers for adjusting, which is disgusting(I got the rhymes woohoo)
